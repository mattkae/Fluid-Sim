Refactors
- Scene class containing:
  ~ A loader? (Kind of big, but worth it)

Features
- Add transparency to lighting
- Optimize draw calls
- Optimize lighting (big subject)
- Come up with scheme for non-static lights

Bugs
- When shadows aren't on, the light is also not on
- Directional Light shadows ~work~ but are dependent on constants...
